## Introduction

Since the passing of Micky Jagtiani, **Renuka Jagtiani** has stepped into a monumental role: preparing Landmark Group for IPO. Her strategy? Offload surplus capital and introduce structured debt before going public.

## The Capital Paradox

Landmark Group is asset-rich and debt-light. But modern capital markets prefer lean, growth-ready balance sheets. Renuka’s job is to fix this optics imbalance.

## Why Create Debt?

- Improve ROE before IPO
- Free capital for aggressive expansion
- Signal financial discipline to institutional investors

## Offloading Strategy

- Selling non-core real estate
- Spinning off verticals like healthcare
- Reclassifying assets into SPVs and trusts

## The Debt Plan

- Sukuk (Islamic bonds)
- Senior secured debt backed by retail revenue
- Convertible notes for strategic investors

## Renuka’s Methodology

- Hired Goldman Sachs as lead advisor
- Reorganized internal audit
- Maintains minimal public profile, maximum execution

## Role of LandmarkGroup.Fund

The fund acts as a capital container, absorbing illiquid and non-core holdings to clean the parent company’s books for IPO.

## Timeline

- Expected IPO in 2026 or 2027
- Dual listing strategy: ADX + LSE or Nasdaq
- Target valuation: $12B–$15B

## Conclusion

Renuka is doing what few can—turning surplus into strategy and debt into discipline, ensuring Landmark’s public debut will be both admired and envied.
