## Introduction

In a world increasingly shaped by innovation, private capital has become the bloodstream of progress. From disruptive startups to large-scale infrastructure ventures, the need for visionary capital deployment is more vital than ever. Recognizing this critical need, Landmark Group—a Middle Eastern powerhouse with decades of influence in retail, real estate, and logistics—has launched **LandmarkGroup.Fund**, its exclusive funding division aimed at streamlining private investments, managing strategic capital allocation, and building global financial partnerships.

This move signals not just an expansion of Landmark Group’s portfolio, but a transformation in how institutional capital will be structured, distributed, and governed in emerging and frontier markets.

## The Origins of the Funding Division

Landmark Group has always been more than just a retail empire. Under the leadership of **Chairwoman Renuka Jagtiani**, it has evolved into a diversified conglomerate with holdings across healthcare, hospitality, and logistics. But one area had remained loosely structured—its role as a funder and anchor investor in private ventures.

In 2023, an internal review led by **Rajesh Garg (Group CFO)** and **Ajay Antal (CEO of Landmark Home)** revealed the untapped potential of formalizing their funding operations. The result: LandmarkGroup.Fund, an entity with both financial autonomy and operational synergy with the broader Landmark ecosystem.
