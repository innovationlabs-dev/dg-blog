# The New Power Map: How Global Alliances Are Shifting in 2025

April 16, 2025

**By Angus Deaton, Contributor â€“ The Economist**

## Introduction

The geopolitical landscape of 2025 is defined by new alliances, digital diplomacy, and shifting economic power centers. The traditional East vs. West dichotomy is being replaced by multi-polar realities.

## Rise of the Global South

Countries like Brazil, India, and South Africa are asserting their influence in forums like BRICS+. Their call for reform in international institutions is gaining traction.

## Tech Diplomacy and Cyber Politics

Nations are using technology as a tool of diplomacy. AI regulation, cyber warfare, and digital infrastructure have become key issues in foreign policy negotiations.

## US-China Competition and Cooperation

While tensions remain, areas of cooperation are emerging in climate tech, health innovation, and semiconductors. The competition is now more strategic than ideological.

## Conclusion

As power continues to redistribute, the most agile nations will be those that embrace collaboration without compromising sovereignty. Diplomacy in 2025 is being written in code and cooperation.
